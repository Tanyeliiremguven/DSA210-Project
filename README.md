# DSA210-Project
Step Count Analysis During Exam Periods

# MOTIVATION AND OVERVIEW

This project aims to analyze my step count and how it gets affected during my exam dates by comparing the step count on exam days and on regular days. 
Since I live on campus, I mostly go anywhere on foot. (such as my room, faculty classes, dining hall, etc.). Hovewer, my physical activities decline in my exam period due to stress levels and time constraints in that period. The goal is to analyze my step count during my exam days and regular days and examine how stress levels and time constraints in my exam periods affect my physical activity patterns.


# DATA SOURCES

In this project I will be using my steps count data and my exam dates data.

- Steps Data:
  
  * Source: Extracted from the 'Health' app on my iphone.
 
  *  Process:
    * Exported all the health data in .xml format to my computer.
    * Step count data extracted from other health metrics by using Python.
    * Steps count data before 2023 extracted from the liste by using Python.
    * Daily step counts calculated day by day and converted to .csv format to analyze easily.
 
- Exam Dates Data:

  * Source: Manually colected external data based on my university's exam schedule.
 
  * Process:
    * Recorded 2024 spring and fall terms exam dates in an Excel file and arrange them chronologically (oldest to newest). 
    * Converted the Excel file to .csv format.
    * Exam dates format was changed to YYYY-MM-DD to correspond with the steps data format.


# OBJECTIVES

- Analyze daily step count data to determine how exam dates affect levels of physical activity.
- Compare the step counts; before, during, after exam days, and regular days (days that are not associated with exam periods).
- Determine patterns or trends in physical activity during exam periods.
- Analyze stress levels and time constraints impacts on daily physical activity.
- Establish if there is any correlation between exam dates and activity levels.


# METHADOLOGY

- Data Collection:
  
  * Export step count data in .xml format from the' Health' app.
  * Manually compile and organize exam dates in .csv format.

- Data Cleaning:
  
  * Eliminate any irrelevant health indicators and address any missing data.
  * Ensure date formats are 'YYYY-MM-DD' for both steps and exam dates datas.
 
- Data Integration:
  
  * Construct a single dataset for analysis by combining exam dates and step data.
  * Label days as; before exam days, exam days, after exam days, and regular days.
 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  
  * Bar Charts: Display the average step counts before, during, and after exams.
  * Time-Series Plots:  Indicate exam dates and show step count trends over time.
  * Compare step counts between exam-related days and regular days.
 
- Statistical Analysis:
  
  * Examine if there are any correlations between exam schedules and step counts and examine their means.
 
- Interpretation and Insights:
  
  * Identify patterns such as declines in physical activity on exam days or recovery trends after exams.
  * Provide practical recommendations on how to maintain balanced physical activity under stressful periods.

# FINDINGS 

Exam-related intervals and regularÂ days showed a significantly different level of physical activity, according to the data. Compared to the mean step count of 6937.02 recorded on non-exam days, the mean step count during exam intervals was significantly lower at 5789.70. This decrease emphasizes the effects of academic stress and limited mobility during high-stress periods on exam periods.

The results of the regression analysis showed that step counts decreased more sharply over time during exam periods (y1 = -19.24x + 17463.90) than during non-exam intervals (y2 = -7.49x + 9433.53). This suggests that during exam periods, step counts are more negatively impacted, most likely as a result of fewer possibilities for physical activity.

These patterns were supported by visualizations, such as histograms, box plots, which revealed greater fluctuation in step counts during non-exam periods and less variability during exam intervals. 

# LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK

Although this study offers insightful information on the connection between exam times and exercise, more research may be possible. The dataset could be expanded in future research to cover more years and a wider range of academic contexts, allowing for a more comprehensive knowledge of patterns in various settings. Other health indicators, including sleep habits, stress levels, or caloric expenditure, could be included to give a more comprehensive picture of how exams affect people's general wellbeing. To determine their role in alterations in activity levels, external factors like the severity of the workload or the surrounding environment could be examined.
