Step Count Analysis During Exam Periods

This project aims to analyze my step count and how it gets affected during my exam dates by comparing the step count on exam days, before exam days, and after exam days. This project's goal is to analyze my step count during my exam days and regular days and examine the how stress level and time constraints affect my physical activities. Since I live in a campus, I mostly go anywhere by walking in a day.( such as my romm, faculty classes, cantinery and etc.) By looking at these datas I will be improving my daily physical activities when they need to be improved. 




In this project I will be using my steps count data and my exam dates data. I get my step data from the 'Health' app on my iPhone. I exported my data in .xml format to my computer. Then by using a Python code, I extracted my step data from my other health datas. After that I calculated my steps data per day by using a python code and converted my daily step count data to .csv format by using another python code. I get my exam date data manually as an external data. I found my 2024  spring term exam dates and 2024  fall term exam dates and wrote them to Excel and sorted them from oldest to newest. Later on, I converted this Excel document to .cvs format on my computer. When I did it, the dates of exams and the dates of steps are written in different format. To avoid any contradiction between them, I change the exam dates format according to steps dates. 





In my future works I will be performing some statistical tests and compare my steps and exam days in a datatset. I will also make comment on other factors that affect my step count per day.
