Step Count Analysis During Exam Periods

This project aims to analyze my step count and how it gets affected during exam dates by comparing the step count on exam days, before exam days, and after exam days.

I get my step data from the 'Health' app on my iPhone. I exported my data in .xml format to my computer. Then by using a Python code, I converted my data to .csv format. I get my exam date data manually. I found my 2024  spring term exam dates and 2024  fall term exam dates and wrote them to Excel and sorted them from oldest to newest. Later on, I converted this Excel document to .cvs format on my computer. When I did it, the dates of exams and the dates of steps are written in different format. To avoid any contradiction between them, I change the exam dates format according to steps dates. 

Later on I did some EDA (exploratory data analysis) on my datas to see if there are some spesific patterns.
